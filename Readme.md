# SPRING-IT

My first mvc project to kick me off

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of this project up and running on your local machine. Documentation is still under construction

### Prerequisites

The things you need to install to get the Spring-it application running:
Up to this moment you'll need Java installed and your prevered IDE.
Also you need to have a mavan wrapper. Thats all. This project is built with Spring boot, therefore actually looking up the plugins is not needed. [Further documentation is still under construction]
